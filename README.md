A (VERY) simple terminal shell written entirely in Python, which uses the OS module.

It isn't very good right now, so contributions would be welcome.

Some ideas I have are:
* Basic autocompletion (for example when you do a command, it saves it to an array. When you do up arrow, it changes the input to the last item from that array)

Update: This now uses bash, so yay!
